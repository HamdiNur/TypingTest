# TypingTest Website

## Overview

This project aims to develop a web application, "Typing Test Website," built using React.js. The website will provide users with a platform to practice their typing skills, track their progress, and customize their experience.

The core features of the website include:

1. **Typing Test:** Users can initiate typing tests, with the system recording their speed, accuracy, and other relevant data.

2. **User Authentication:** The website utilizes Firebase Authentication, allowing users to create accounts, sign in, and save their typing test results.

3. **Data Storage:** Firestore, the NoSQL database from Firebase, will store user accounts and their typing test results.

4. **User Profile:** A dedicated user page will display the user's typing test history, personal bests, and an option to update their profile information.

5. **Timing Feature:** Users can set a timer for their typing tests, adding a challenging element.

 6. **"Compare Feature"** t hat allows users to compare their typing test results with their past performances and with other users, encouraging friendly competition.

## Core Features

### Typing Test
This is the central feature of the website, where users can initiate typing tests, and the system records their speed, accuracy, and other relevant data.

### User Authentication
The website uses Firebase Authentication to enable users to:
- Create accounts
- Sign in
- Save their typing test results

### Data Storage
Firestore, the NoSQL database from Firebase, will store user accounts and their typing test results.

### User Profile
A dedicated user page will display:
- Typing test history
- Personal bests

### Timing Feature
Users can set a timer for their typing tests, adding a challenging element to the experience.



### Compare Feature
This optional feature allows users to compare their typing test results:
- With their past performances
- With other users, encouraging friendly competition

## Challenges Faced
## Integrating Firebase
One of the key challenges I faced in this project was the integration of Firebase, as I had no prior experience with this platform. However, I proactively addressed this challenge by conducting extensive research and learning how to effectively utilize Firebase Authentication and Firestore database services. This learning process involved understanding the setup, configuration, and implementation of these Firebase features within the React.js application.


This project aims to help users improve their typing skills through a personalized and engaging experience. The combination of a well-designed user interface, performance tracking, and optional comparison features will provide users with a comprehensive typing practice platform.
